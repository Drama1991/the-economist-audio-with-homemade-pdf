# the-economist-audio-with-homemade-pdf
The project uses spider scripts to gather data from https://www.economist.com, then generates PDF files (including figure toggled versions) by LaTeX and finds their corresponding compressed audio URL.

Two PDF files and an audio URL file are included in each *The Economist* issue directory.

Pull requests and issues are welcomed.

## 临时暂停更新

因为计划任务所在的设备升级，数据也需要迁移，因此暂停更新一段时间，预计九月份之前恢复.
